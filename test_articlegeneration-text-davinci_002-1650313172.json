KPMG is alleged to have used a complex network of companies and offshore trusts to help its clients avoid paying taxes on their tobacco sales.\n\nThe three companies at the centre of the investigation are accused of using KPMG's services to avoid paying millions of pounds in taxes.\n\n Francis Gingham is also being investigated by the HMRC for his involvement in a tech start up in Costa Rica. The company is accused of using the darkweb to sell illegal drugs and weapons.\n\nThis is a developing story and more details will be released as they become available.",
