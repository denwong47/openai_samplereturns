    "origin": "Costa Rican authorities arrested on Monday 28 employees at various public offices and prominent construction companies as part of an investigation into illegal kickback schemes involving public works projects. Those detained are suspected of bribery, fraud and influence peddling, and include senior businessmen of several construction companies and various officials connected to the National Highway Council (CONAVI). Also implicated is top presidential aide Camilo Saldarriaga, who had served as President Carlos Alvadaro\u2019s campaign manager in 2018. Though Saldarriaga was not arrested, he announced his resignation from his advisory post on Monday, which the President promptly acknowledged. The sweeping investigation involved a total of 650 agents of the country\u2019s Judicial Investigation Organization (OIJ) and the Deputy Prosecutor\u2019s Office, who participated in 57 simultaneous raids carried out across the country to collect evidence. Cases are being built against 40 more, head judicial investigator Walter Espinoza told local media outlets. The raids were carried out in MECO \u2014 the largest construction company in Central America \u2014 and HSOL\u00cdS, another mega-construction company based in San Jose that has completed more than 1,000 public works projects. Investigators also raided ITP, CASISA, Constructora Herrera, Constructora Montedes, and Alsofrutales as well as private residences and the offices of the CONAVI. MECO and HSOL\u00cdS representatives did not respond to a request for comment. In a public address, President Quesada firmly condemned corruption and offered his support to judicial authorities. \u201cWhere there is a corrupt person, there is also a corrupter, and both must be punished,\u201d Quesada said. \u201cIt is my wish, like that of the rest of the Costa Ricans, that the bottom of the matter be reached and that responsibilities and sanctions be felt.\u201d Saldarriaga reportedly said in a statement to El Mundo that he resigned to dedicate himself fully to proving his innocence without affecting the work of the executive branch. Saldarriaga maintained his innocence and indicated that he has not received any gifts or bribes for his work. Investigator Espinoza said that the OIJ probe had started in 2019 after tips that CONAVI officials had been prioritising select companies in public works and highway projects in exchange for favors, including money, vehicles, property, travel and personal gains. He called the investigation \u201cone of the most important in recent months.\u201d The scheme is estimated to have created a budget deficit of US$127 million between 2018 and 2020. According to local media, investigators obtained court permission to install wiretaps in the fall of 2019, which allowed them to gather evidence over 19 months of a bribery network between private companies and public officials."
