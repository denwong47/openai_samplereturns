    "origin": "Productivity and growth can be measured using Gross Value Added (GVA), which is a key economic indicator. It measures the performance of each individual producer or industry and their input to the economy. Data on GVA is published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) at the end of each calendar year. The assessment uses the balanced measure (B), which is produced by combining income and production approach measures using weighted quality metrics. GVA(B) data is available at various geographical levels and by various industry groups. Each time data is published, ONS also publishes revisions to past data; this means that values for a particular year may differ in different publications.\n\nMost recent data (2019) estimates the Southampton economy to be worth 7.8 billion, which is a decline of -0.6% compared to the previous year. Despite this decline, economic growth up to this point was relatively healthy. Additionally, GVA(B) per head of population in Southampton (\u00a330,865) was higher than the national average (\u00a330,239) in 2019. GVA(B) per head is a useful way of comparing regions of different sizes and is an important indicator for benchmarking economic growth.\n\nHowever, the economic landscape has changed considerably in the last 12 months due to coronavirus. PwC published quick and slow recovery scenarios for UK GVA in 2020 and 2021 in their January 2021 UK Economic Outlook. The quick recovery scenario assumes a fast roll out of the vaccine, which would front-load most of the recovery in those hardest hit sectors, for example, hospitality and transport. It also assumes a loosening of social distancing restrictions in the first few months of 2021 allowing consumers to return to shops, pubs and restaurants. Under a quick recovery scenario PwC estimate that across the UK GVA shrunk by -11% in 2020 but is predicted to grow by 4.8% in 2021. A slow recovery scenario assumes recovery is hampered by the extension of social distancing restrictions due to a slower vaccine roll out, as well as businesses being slow to adapt to the end of the Brexit transition period. Under a slow recovery scenario PwC estimate that across the UK GVA shrunk by -11% in 2020 but is predicted to grow by 2.2% in 2021. These estimates can be applied to Southampton to give an indication of the potential impact of coronavirus on productivity and growth. Using 2019 GVA(B) data as a baseline the Southampton economy could shrink between -\u00a3500 and -\u00a3700 million by 2021 (based on quick and slow recovery scenarios published by PwC).\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019 financial & insurance activities (-\u00a3277 million) and information & communication (-\u00a327 million) experienced the greatest declines in GVA(B). The largest growth in GVA(B) was in transportation and storage (+\u00a3116 million) and professional, scientific and technical activities (+\u00a357 million).\n\nAgain, the above picture does not capture the impact of coronavirus on different industries productivity and growth in Southampton. PwC also produced quick and slow recovery scenario estimates for GVA by industry, which were applied to the industrial profile of Southampton to give an indication of which industries were likely hardest hit and recovery of these industries. Very few industries are expected to recover to 2019 levels by 2021 under both scenarios; the only industry estimated to grow by 2021 under both scenarios is the public sector. The transportation and storage industry is likely to be hardest hit; transportation and storage is the largest contributor to Southampton\u2019s economy (25% of GVA in 2019). Retail, education, administration & support, accommodation & food services as well as arts, entertainment and recreation are also hit hard under both scenarios."
